#Bank Transaction Analysis Proj.

For this Project I Generated a random set of financial transactions using Chat Gpt, asking it to keep it raw similar to how banks usually give them out. Upon doing so I Utilized Excel Power Query Editor to clean and format the Data. after cleaning the Data, I now had a 120 row set of Data ready to be processed. This data was uploaded to kaggle for Data Analyis and Visualization.

My Goal for this Analysis was to see, how much money did this user spend per month, and in what month did they spend the most.  
- This was visualized on a Column chart and the month of highest expensed was enouunced.  
  
In addition to this I wanted to separate the complete year's spending by category, seeing how much did he spend in each category.  
- This was visualized on a Color Coded Donut chart, with Color and CAtegory Guide. (the amount of money spent per category was not shown, instead the percentage of the total that pertains to each category is shown.)  

  
In summary the goals I had for this project were fufilled, However this can be drastically optimized with more analizations based on this same data, More Acurate and User-Friendly Charts, Predictive Analizations and AI, and so much more.
I plan on returning to this project and optimizing it, as I gain more knowledge and experience in the Data Analytics environment.
